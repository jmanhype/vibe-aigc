    "overview":  "Implement the feedback loop mechanism from the Vibe AIGC paper (arXiv:2602.04575). Add adaptive planning that can refine workflows based on execution results, implement parallel execution for independent nodes, and add workflow visualization.\n\n**Motivation:** The paper\u0027s architecture shows a feedback loop from execution back to the Meta-Planner. This enables adaptive workflows that can recover from failures and optimize based on results.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Feedback mechanism that sends execution results back to MetaPlanner\n- Adaptive replanning when nodes fail\n- Parallel execution of independent workflow nodes\n- Workflow visualization (ASCII/Mermaid diagrams)\n- Progress callbacks during execution\n- Workflow persistence and resume capability\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must integrate with existing MetaPlanner and WorkflowExecutor\n- Use asyncio.gather for parallel execution\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API",
