  "overview": "Implement the foundational Vibe AIGC system based on arXiv:2602.04575. Create the Vibe data model (high-level aesthetic/intent representation) and MetaPlanner class that decomposes Vibes into executable agentic pipelines.\n\n**Motivation:** Bridge the Intent-Execution Gap by enabling users to express high-level creative intent (Vibe) and have the system automatically generate and execute hierarchical agent workflows.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Vibe dataclass with description, style, constraints, domain fields\n- MetaPlanner class that accepts Vibe and generates WorkflowPlan\n- WorkflowNode structure for hierarchical task decomposition\n- Integration with LLM for intelligent decomposition\n- Basic execution engine for running generated workflows\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Python 3.12+\n- Pydantic for data validation\n- Async/await for execution\n- OpenAI-compatible LLM client",
